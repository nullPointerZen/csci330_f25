# Assignment Submissions - CSCI 330

This directory contains student assignment submissions using a professional Git workflow with Pull Requests.

## Directory Structure

Each student creates their own directory following this naming pattern:
```
assignments/
└── CSCI330_FirstName_LastName/
    ├── week01/
    ├── week02/
    ├── week03/
    └── [additional weeks as assigned]
```

## Submission Workflow

     cd COURSE_REPO_NAME
     ```

2. **Add Upstream Remote**

   git pull upstream main
   git push origin main
   ```

   git checkout -b week01-assignment-name
   # Example: git checkout -b week01-pointers-basics
   ```

3. **Complete Your Work**
   - Copy assignment template to your directory:
