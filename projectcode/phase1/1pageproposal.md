# Snake Game Proposal

## What I'm Building
A console-based Snake game in C++ with basic movement, food collection, and collision detection. The snake grows when it eats food and the game ends if it hits a wall or itself.

## Why It's Interesting
Itâ€™s a classic game that lets me apply C++ features like `std::deque`, object management, and input handling. I like how simple rules create complex behavior.

## Main Challenge
Handling movement and collisions cleanly, especially growing the snake and avoiding self-collision.
