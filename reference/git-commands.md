git push origin --delete branch-name  # Delete remote branch
```

## Synchronization Commands

### Keep Fork Updated

git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

### Update Feature Branch

git pull upstream main
git checkout your-feature-branch
git merge main
```

## Commit Best Practices

### Good Commit Messages
```bash
git commit -m "Implement pointer arithmetic functions

- Add pointer_add() with bounds checking
- Add pointer_subtract() with validation  
- Include comprehensive test cases"
```

### Commit Frequently
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add basic function structure"
git commit -m "Implement error handling"
git commit -m "Add unit tests"
git commit -m "Update documentation"
```

## Pull Request Commands

### Submit for Review
```bash
# After final commit:
git push origin your-branch-name
# Then create PR on GitHub
```

### Address PR Feedback
```bash
# Make requested changes, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Address PR feedback: fix memory leak"
git push origin your-branch-name
# PR updates automatically
```

## Troubleshooting Commands

### See What Changed
```bash
git diff                    # Show unstaged changes
git diff --staged          # Show staged changes  
git diff HEAD~1            # Compare with previous commit
```

### Undo Changes
```bash
git checkout -- file.cpp   # Discard unstaged changes to file
git reset HEAD file.cpp     # Unstage file (keep changes)
git reset --hard HEAD       # Discard ALL unstaged changes (⚠️ dangerous)
```

### Fix Last Commit
```bash
git commit --amend -m "Better commit message"  # Fix commit message
git add forgotten_file.cpp
git commit --amend --no-edit                   # Add file to last commit
```

### Resolve Merge Conflicts
```bash
git status                  # See conflicted files
# Edit files (look for <<<< ==== >>>>)
git add .                   # Mark conflicts as resolved
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

## Information Commands

### Repository Status
```bash
git remote -v               # Show all remotes
git log --graph --oneline   # Visual commit history
git show                    # Show latest commit details
```

### File History
```bash
git log -- file.cpp         # Show commits affecting specific file
git blame file.cpp          # Show who changed each line
```

## Emergency Commands

### Accidentally on Main Branch
```bash
# If you made changes on main instead of feature branch:
git checkout -b week01-assignment-name  # Create branch with current changes
# Now you're on the correct branch!
```

### Lost Changes
```bash
git reflog                  # Show recent actions
git checkout HEAD@{2}       # Go back to specific state
```

### Need to Start Over
```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b week01-assignment-name-v2
# Copy your work manually if needed
```

## Common Error Solutions

### "Branch already exists"
```bash
git checkout existing-branch-name     # Switch to it instead
# OR delete it first:
git branch -d old-branch-name
git checkout -b week01-assignment-name
```

### "Nothing to commit"
```bash
git status                  # Check if files are staged
git add .                   # Stage files if needed
```

### "Merge conflict"
1. `git status` shows conflicted files
2. Open files and look for `<<<<`, `====`, `>>>>` markers
3. Edit to resolve conflicts
4. `git add .` and `git commit -m "Resolve conflicts"`

### "Permission denied"
- Check if you're pushing to your fork (origin), not upstream
- Verify GitHub credentials/tokens are set up

**💡 Pro Tips:**
- Use `git status` frequently to stay oriented
- Commit early and often - you can always squash later  
- Read error messages carefully - they usually tell you exactly what to do
- When in doubt, ask for help rather than forcing commands
- Keep this reference handy until commands become muscle memory!
